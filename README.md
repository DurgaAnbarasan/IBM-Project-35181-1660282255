## :arrow_right: ***Introduction***
###### _Fertilizer Recommentation system for Disease Prediction is a simple ML and DL based website which recommends the best crop to grow, fertilizers to use and the diseases caught by your crops.Application of Computer vision and image processing strategies simply assist farmers in all of our Regions of Agriculture_
## :chains: ***Problem Statement***
###### _Agriculture is the most important sector in todayâ€™s life. Most plants are affected by a wide variety of bacterial and fungal diseases. Diseases on plants placed a major constraint on the production and a major threat to food security. Hence, early and accurate identification of plant diseases is essential to ensure high quantity and best quality. In recent years, the number of diseases on plants and the degree of harm caused has increased due to the variation in pathogen varieties, changes in cultivation methods, and inadequate plant protection techniques. An automated system is introduced to identify different diseases on plants by checking the symptoms shown on the leaves of the plant. Deep learning techniques are used to identify the diseases and suggest the precautions that can be taken for those diseases._
## :shamrock: ***Problem Solution***
###### _The solution to the problem is Machine learning, which is one of the applications of Artificial Intelligence, is being used to implement the proposed system. Crop recommendation is going to recommend you the best crop you can grow in your land as per the soil nutrition value and along with as per the climate in that region. And recommending the best fertilizer for every particular crop is also a challenging task. And the other and most important issue is when a plant gets caught by heterogeneous diseases that effect on less amount of agriculture production and compromises with quality as well. To overcome all these issues this recommendation has been proposed . Nowadays a lot of research and work is being implemented in the smart and modern agriculture domain. Crop recommendation is characterized by a soil database comprised of Nitrogen, Phosphorus, potassium. The ensembles technique is used to build a recommendation model that combines the prediction of multiple machine learning. Models to recommend the right crop based on soil value and the best fertilizer to use._
